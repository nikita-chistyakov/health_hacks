### **Four Glucose Hacks from the Interview with the Glucose Goddess (Jessie InchauspÃ©)**

1. **Savory Breakfast**  
   - Avoid sugar and refined carbs in the morning.  
   - Instead, eat **protein, healthy fats, and fiber** (e.g., eggs, nuts, avocado, Greek yogurt).  
   - This prevents a **glucose roller coaster** throughout the day, reducing energy crashes and cravings.  

2. **One Tablespoon of Vinegar Before a Meal**  
   - Drinking **one tablespoon of vinegar diluted in water** before a meal reduces glucose spikes by up to 30%.  
   - Vinegar slows down digestion and insulin response, leading to **fewer cravings and more stable energy**.  

3. **Eat Vegetables First**  
   - Start each meal with **fiber-rich vegetables** to **create a protective barrier** in the gut.  
   - This slows the absorption of glucose into the bloodstream, reducing spikes.  
   - A small plate of veggies before a carb-heavy meal can make a **big difference**.  

4. **Move After Eating**  
   - Engaging in **light movement for 10 minutes after a meal** (e.g., walking, dancing, cleaning, calf raises)  
   - Helps muscles absorb glucose, reducing spikes and **preventing energy crashes**.

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Glucose spikes lead to energy crashes, cravings, inflammation, aging, and weight gain.**  
- **All sugar is the same**, whether from fruit, honey, or processed foodsâ€”it all spikes glucose.  
- **Insulin plays a major role** in fat storage; frequent spikes increase insulin resistance.  
- **Muscle mass helps regulate glucose**, so strength training can improve glucose management.  
- **Glucose regulation is linked to fertility, mental health, skin health, and aging.**  
- **Glucose spikes affect cognitive function**, and stable glucose improves focus and productivity.  

These small **science-backed changes** can **help balance glucose** without extreme dieting! ðŸš€
